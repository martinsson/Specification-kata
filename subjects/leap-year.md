### Leap year calculator
We need a function that can tell us if a given year is a leap year or not.
Both past and present years are valid. Years before the year 0 need not be considered

### Rules
Try to find the rules.

### Examples
#### Rule 1
1. example 1 for rule 1
2. example 2 for rule 1
3. ...

#### Rule 2
...


### Resources
A more precise spec can be found at https://codingdojo.org/kata/LeapYears/. 
But typically googling around can make it a more interesting exercice. The key is to realize that 
the rule of every four years is not the only rule.
